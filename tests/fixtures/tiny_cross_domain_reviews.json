{"text":"A fantastic dialog- oriented movie. This is easily Tarantino's best effort. Though I did not appreciate this movie the first time I saw it, I now know why it is a cult classic. The characters are good and the dialogs are intriguing. S.Jackson was...(read more) easily the best actor for me, delivering the best lines, while the rest of of the cast was also good. The duo of Jackson and Travolta goes down as one of my favorites ever; they both complemented each other really well. The chemistry between Thurman & Travolta was also quite effective.This dark comedy also has some great funny moments which never lets the movie drag despite its lengthy running time.Overall, a highly entertaining dark comedy packed with great lines & acting. A Tarantino classic.","label":6,"scale_points":10,"task_ids":1}
