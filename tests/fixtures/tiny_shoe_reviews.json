{"label":1,"text":"I have had the Patricia II wedge in black for about 1 year & wore them regularly in season.  When I saw the Patricia at a good price in navy (from 6pm), I purchased them because I thought they would fit just like my Patricia IIs.  I was wrong, and paid the price with return shipping that 6pm doesn't pay.<br \/><br \/>The crocs website says that crocs aren't suppose to fit like other sandals - they are suppose to be looser & thus more comfortable - I normally wear an 8-1\/2, so have now tried both an 8 & a 9 in the Patricia shoe (I have an 8 in the Patricia II).  The Patricia 9 swims on my feet & they would be a hazard to walk around in.  The size 8 fits my left foot (which is my wider foot) but is too narrow on my right foot.  When I placed the shoes sole to sole, I did notice a slight difference in the width, which, apparently, my foot notices too.  I can only conclude a manufacturing defect.  But, it is this shoe specifically or the form for this shoe? (others have written the shoe is narrow).<br \/><br \/>Consequently, if you have a wider foot, order the Patricia II instead of this one & if you are a 1\/2 size, order down, not up."}
